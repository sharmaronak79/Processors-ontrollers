I2C Info – I2C Bus, Interface and Protocol

I2C is a serial protocol for two-wire interface to connect low-speed devices like microcontrollers, EEPROMs, A/D and D/A converters, 
I/O interfaces and other similar peripherals in embedded systems. It was invented by Philips and now it is used by almost all major IC manufacturers. 
Each I2C slave device needs an address – they must still be obtained from NXP (formerly Philips semiconductors).
