1) Immediate addressing mode
   Data given in instruction 
   E.g mov a, #70h
       Mov R0, #56h

2) Register addressing mode 
   Register given in instruction and its value is transferred
   E.g, Mov a, R0
        Mov R1, a

3) direct addressing mode 
    Address given in instruction,  data from that location is transferred 
   E.g , Mov A, 30h   // w/o # it is address
         Mov 42h , A

4) Indirect addressing mode 
    Used as pointer, dptr is used
First initialize dptr with one number , after that number will be address and exchange happen on that location
    E.g Mov Dptr, #40h  // 40 will go in dptr
        Mov 40h, #70h   // 70 will go at location 40h
        Mov A, @Dptr    // here data of dptr will b now address , so data at location 40h will go in A
     

5) Index addressing mode
