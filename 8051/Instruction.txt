Two types of instruction set


1. Arithmetic operation  


For simple arithmetic operation 
like 
addition ADD A , #25H  data 25
         ADD A, 25H    data on address 25h
         ADD A, @R0    data on address pointed by R0 register

Subtract SUB A, 30H

Multiplication MUL A, 35H

Division DIV A, #20H



2. Logical operation 

AND , OR , XOR 
 
Some operation that we cannot do by arithmetic operation 
In that case we have to use logical operation
If we want to operate on particular bit or nibble then 
We have to use logical instructions 

ANL A, #25H Anding logically 

ORL A, #20H oring logically 


3. Bit operation

If we want to perform on particular bit operation then 
This instruction are used

As in previous instructions in this the carry bit works as accumulator

Set B to make all one's
Clear C mean make it empty or zeros

CPL C, means complement


4. Exchange instructions 

 XCH A, 25H, means exchange data of A and data of 25 address

One more important is XCHD 
Xchd is used to exchange lower bit means if there two days like 34 and 56
Then after xchd it will swap only lower bit 
So it will be 36 and 54
