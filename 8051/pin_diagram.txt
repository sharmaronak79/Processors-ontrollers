for the simplicity i gave simple 0 to 39 

port 0: 
pin 0 to 7
AD0 - AD7 (Address and data bus)
port 1:
pin 8 to 15
port 2:
pin 16 to 23
A8 - A15 (Address bus)
port 3:
pin 24 to 31

p3.0 - TxD
p3.1 - RxD
p3.2 -INT0'
p3.3 -INT1'
p3.4 -Timer0
p3.5 -Timer1
p3.6 -RD'
p3.7- WR'

We can use it as normal Bus if we dont want to use this for special task as mentioned 

gemeral purpose :
32 to 39

1) osc1
2) osc2

3)Reset
4)ALE - Address latch Enable (when it is active it will use to active for address bus for port 0, because it carries address and data)

5)EA' - External accessable (active low) {use to access external memory for RAM}
6)PSEN - programme state enable {use to access external memory for ROM}

7)VCC
8)GND


we can use maximum external memory up to 64KB(RAM) + 64KB(ROM)
