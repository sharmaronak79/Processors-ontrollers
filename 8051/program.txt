1) WAP to add the contents of internak RAM locations 41h and40h, an dstore sum to 42h an darry to 43h
       MOV 43H ,#40H // initialize 43h as 00 for carry 
       MOV A, 40H
       ADD A,41H
       MOV 42H,A  // to store sum
       JNC SKIP
       INC 43H   //TO store carry
 SKIP: SJMP SKIP
 
 2) WAP to multiply the numbers B2H and F2H. store resuklt in register R0 (LSB) and R1 (MSB) of bank 2
 
 for bank 2 we have to set RS1 snd reset RS0 of psw bit 4 and 3

     SET PSD.4
     CLR PSW.3
     MOV A, #0B2H
     MOV B, #2FH
     MUL AB
     MOV R0,A
     MOV R1,B
HERE: SJMP HERE
 
 
 3) WAP TO ADD A SERIES OF 10 NUMBERS , series stsrt from locations 20h in internal RAM, store the result at locations 30h and 31h
 
   START :MOV R1,#0AH
          MOV R0,#20H
          CLR A
          MOV B,#00H
   REPEAT:ADD A, @R0
          JNC SKIP
          INC B
     SKIP:INC RO
          DJNZ R1, REPEAT
          MOV 30H, A
          MOV 31H, B
